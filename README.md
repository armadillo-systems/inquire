# inquire
iNQUIRE is a digital research platform, designed to surface any digital repository using any metadata schema. Coded in HTML5, and leveraging the power of a Solr index via RESTful requests, it's a customisable framework designed to fast-track your digital access ambitions, whatever file formats, schemas and repositories you use. Now supporting IIIF.

Some old documentation can be found here, this is for non-IIIF configuration, and assumes you have an existing Solr index and image server:

Updated documentation is in progress and will appear soon.
