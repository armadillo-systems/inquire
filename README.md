# iNQUIRE
iNQUIRE is a digital research platform, designed to surface any digital repository using any metadata schema. Coded in ASP.NET MVC and with a responsive HTML5/Knockout frontend, it utilises the power of a Solr index via RESTful requests. It's a customisable framework designed to fast-track your digital access ambitions, whatever file formats, schemas and repositories you use. Now supporting the IIIF Presentation API and Image API.

Some old documentation can be found here, this is for non-IIIF configuration, and assumes you have an existing Solr index and image server:

Updated documentation is in progress and will appear soon.

You can see iNQUIRE running at Digital Bodleian:
